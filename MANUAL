SAMCompare MANUAL

SAMCompare is written in Python and runs from Python 3.5.1 onward. See README for installation instructions.
Make sure to run with running with `python3` command. The output is written to stdout.

Input Specifications

	- SAM files must have matching headers.

Commands and Options

	Basic Command Structure:

		$ python3 compare.py <flag> <path>
			# Flags can come in any order but must be followed by corresponding information
			# Running the program without any flags or additional arguments will print the manual

	Flags

		-man
			# Prints Commands and Options section of MANUAL
			# Does not run the script if included, only prints the MANUAL

		-1 <path> (required)
			# Followed by the path/to/file_name_1.sam

		-2 <path> (required)
			# Followed by the path/to/file_name_2.sam

		-ex_count <int> (optional)
			# Followed by the number of example alignments to print.
			# Come from the first <int> headers that differ between files.
			# Default is 0 example headers to print

		-no_stats (optional)
			# Does not print statistics

Understanding Output

	Headers
		- Reports the number of unique headers
		- Paired end read mates are both counted as the same header
	Records
		- Each line in alignment section in SAM file is a record
		- Both mapped and unmapped reads count as a record
	Records per Header
		- Number of records / number of headers
	Alignments
		- Records that have been successfully mapped
		- Based of 0x4 bit in FLAG 
	Alignments per Header
		- Number of alignments / number of headers
	Unmapped
		- Number of records - number of alignments

	No change
		- No difference between the headers' records
	Number of Alignments
		- Header in one file has different number of records than header in other file
		- Checked before Mapped Position (higher hierarchy)
	Mapped Position
		- Difference in RNAME or POS for alignments in header
		- To check mapped position, headers must have same amount of records
		- Occurs when a record is unmapped in one file and mapped in another or when
		  records are mapped to two different places
