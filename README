SAMCompare

The script compare.py creates a dictionary of SAM headers objects that hold all of the records for each header. Each record contains a few significant fields: FLAG, MAPQ, RNAME, POS, AS, and NM. By comparing the header objects, SAMCompare helps to answer the following questions:
	
- Alignment Differences
	- Is the mapped position different?
	- Is the total alignment better if the mapped position has changed?
	- Has the number if alignments per header changed?
- Statitics for each SAM file
	- Headers 
	- Alignments
	- Alignments per Header
	- Records per Header
	- Records
	- Unmapped Alignments
	- Uniquely Unmapped
- Additional Features
	- Lists FLAG, MAPQ, RNAME, POS, AS, and NM for headers that differ between files

Version

- Version 1.2 includes new statistics for each SAM and in the comparision of SAM files.
- Version 1.1 reduces the memory usage by 50% and reduces runtime significantly and supports both paired end and single end reads.
- Version 1.0 supports only paired end reads.
